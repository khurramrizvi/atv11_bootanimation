## Android TV 11 Boot Animation

<p>The Boot Animation is directly extracted from the latest Android 11 Beta Image for <b>ADT-3 Developer Kit.</b><br>

<b>The new boot animation is such a Eye Candy that I decided to port it for all other android tv boxesüòò</b>
</p>


## How to Install

* Root Access is a <b> MUST. </b>
* Download the Boot Animation File from <a href="https://github.com/khurramrizvi/atv11_bootanimation/blob/master/Working%20and%20Tested/bootanimation.zip">here</a>
* Use any Root Explorer Apps like <b>root explorer, ZArchiver etc.</b>
* place the file under ```\system\media\ ``` of root directory of your device. <br>
<b>Note: make sure that directory is mounted in R/W mode</b>

### Highlight
* Tried installing the file through Android App: <b> Boot Animations for Superusers</b> from JRummy Apps, but the boot animation got resized and looked <b>UGLUYYYY!!!</b>
* So try installing using above steps only for <b>desired</b> result.

### Testing
* Tested and found working on <b>TX3 Mini</b> Android Box
